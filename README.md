Step into the tense, atmospheric streets of a South African township after dark. In "The Chance Exists," every choice is a gamble.

Live the Statistics. Play as one of three protagonists, each with unique risks based on real South African crime data.

At critical junctions, you must choose one of two paths. Your decision is final, locking you into a scenario with its own challenges and statistical odds of survival.

Explore a meticulously crafted 3D environment of a rural South African township, brought to life with immersive sound design and comic-book style cutscenes.

Every interaction matters. Finding a hidden item like a bat can save your life, while a wrong turn can lead to a devastating, illustrated narrative consequence.

"The Chance Exists" is more than just a game. It is an impactful and thought-provoking experience that highlights serious social issues of safety, vulnerability, and the weight of every decision.
